                                        As I reflect, with an enormous sense of personal and professional pride, on Gatewayâ€™s twenty-fifth
anniversary, I am struck by the sweep of history that we have experienced and witnessed during these
years.
                                    
                                    </p>

<p>When my father started the Gateway Institute of Advanced Studies back in 1986, our family was
going through a troubled time. My father had recently been removed from his post at D.S. Senanayake
College due to various political manoeuvrings and my younger brother had recently passed
away under tragic circumstances. But my fatherâ€™s vision for Gateway was clear, and his passion and
dedication to his mission never wavered. To see where Gateway College has come from such modest
beginnings fills me with happiness and a sense of achievement that I share, collectively, with other
members of the Gateway family.</p>
                                    
<p>And Gateway is, indeed, a family affair. Seeing my fatherâ€™s struggles in the early days, his wife and
children all pitched in to help him in every way we could. My mother Rohini has always been a vital
contributor. In particular, she and my wife Dinali have expertly managed and developed our primary
schools. When it comes to people management, they are both extremely capable, and they dedicate a
tremendous amount of time talking and listening to, empathizing with and understanding our pupils
and staff. Their efforts ensure that we live up to our concept and vision of the term â€˜Gateway familyâ€™.
And now, a younger generation of our family â€“ my nephew Ramantha and my niece Anishka â€“ has
joined the leadership of the school and taken up the challenge of steering Gateway into the future.</p>
                                    
                                    
<p>But â€˜Gateway familyâ€™ has always meant something much larger than just my family. Gateway,
from its very inception, has been a community of staff, management, students and parents coming
together to build not just the school itself, but a wider sense of fraternity and purpose. Everyone who
has ever been a part of the school has played a role in its success; and every part of the journey has
been consequential â€“ from the major decisions and initiatives that shaped the course of the school to
the everyday interactions and moments that, through their countless repetition, have served to build
the Gateway identity.</p>
                                    
                                    
<p>As for myself, I have been involved in the running of Gateway from the very inception. Following
in the footsteps of a father as illustrious and influential as Ralph Alles has, at times, been daunting,
but I have always been keen to try out different ideas: many of Gatewayâ€™s subsidiary entities, such
as the computer school and language school, were born out of this trait of mine. Even in the early
days, when my father devoted his considerable energies to the conventional schools while I oversaw
the subsidiary institutes and academies, we had a clear idea for the kind of experience we wanted to
provide for the Gateway pupil and the institution we needed to build to provide it. So we channelled
all our earnings from the subsidiaries into the conventional schools, investing all we could afford in
land and infrastructure to establish and furnish them. Looking at where we are now, it is clear that
we made the right decision.</p>
                                    
<p>*</p>
                                    
<p>But the story of Gateway College and our Gateway family is not one that can be told in isolation: it
has always been bound up, inextricably, with larger shifts in the story of our country.</p>
                                    
                                    
<p>As circumstances would have it, the twenty-fifth anniversary of Gateway College comes at moment
of dire economic and political crisis in Sri Lanka. The masses are being pushed to the brink,
facing impossible choices in a struggle to survive. For many, faith in the countryâ€™s leadership and
institutions has been profoundly â€“ perhaps irreparably â€“ shaken. A sense of despondency is palpable
and overwhelming. Calls for resilience ring hollow, and the shape of the countryâ€™s future remains
uncertain.</p>
                                    
                                    
<p>And so I am provoked to ask, in a time of national anguish and existential doubt, what is the place
of a school like Gateway? What role can it play? How does what we do as a school matter?</p>
                                    
                                    
<p>There are no easy answers to these questions, but it is important that we keep thinking about
them, keep engaging with them. The way I see it, there are three kinds of schools: those that prepare
their pupils mainly for exams and university, those that prepare pupils mainly for life, and those that
do both. We have always aimed to be in the third category. The world is growing increasingly competitive:
today, conventional academic education and qualifications are more important to success
in adult life than ever before, and our rigorous academic curriculum is designed to offer our pupils
the best preparation. Yet, in order to ready a young person properly for life, we also need to provide
a wide range of experiential activities outside the main curriculum: sports, co-curricular activities,
life skills training, cultural immersion. And, moreover, an education in values, ethics, morality and
responsibility; an education that nurtures a sense of connection and belonging to our society and
country: the very things that help young people learn how to, precisely, live in todayâ€™s world.</p>
                                    
                                    
<p>To the extent that we have been able to provide this kind of holistic education to our pupils, I am
immensely gratified. But it is not a task we take lightly, and we are resolved to keep striving for better.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In that sense, our twenty-fifth anniversary marks something of an end of an era and an opening of
a new one. Our schools now have facilities that are second to none. There are only a few projects left
to complete, some of which are already well under way. By and large, Gateway has reached maturity
in terms of its physical form.</p>
<p>The next step in our growth as an institution and a participant in Sri Lankan society, therefore, is
to nurture people who think differently and are not afraid to take risks, people who are independent
learners as well as creative and critical thinkers. I am speaking here of both our educationists (our
teachers and administrators) and pupils â€“ because this development happens dialectically, symbiotically.</p>
                                    
<p>                                    
In terms of staff, my chosen mission in the next few years is to find and develop such people, thus
strengthening our second and third-tier leadership. Since I began this effort about ten years ago, we
have already seen many capable people move up the ladder. Gateway stands to benefit enormously
as they take up new roles, conceiving and realizing innovation, providing leadership to carry the
school forward.</p>
                                    
<p>And their progress will nourish â€“ and in turn be nourished by â€“ the progress of our student body.
Because after all, they are the centre of what we do, the very raison dâ€™Ãªtre of Gateway itself.</p>
                                    
<p>*</p>
<p>It is for this reason that we felt that our pupils needed to not simply be written about in the book but
have a hand in the bookâ€™s authorship â€“ just as they have had a hand in the creation of the school
itself.</p>
<p>The concept of this book, while unconventional, is deceptively simple. Part 1 is a history of Gatewayâ€™s
twenty-five years from 1997 to the present day. Part 2 is a series of student projects exploring
how the world will look like twenty-five years from now when they, as a generation, will come into
their own.</p>
<p>I would like to think that this captures the true essence of the Gateway approach. Our aim has
been to give our pupils the best possible choices, helping them discover their real strengths and passions,
their sense of purpose and joy. Whether it is academic subjects or sports or clubs and societies,
we want our pupils to gain as broad an experience of education as possible, thus doing as much as
we can to equip them to face life in all its glorious, daunting unpredictability. And once equipped, we
place our trust in them to author their own future â€“ and the future of the world they are assuming â€“
with courage, creativity, and compassion.</p>
