		<p>Gateway International School, Colombo, was declared open on  15 January 1997. It had two branches: a primary division located in a rented house at Gothami Road, Colombo, and a secondary division housed at nearby Rodney Street, on the premises of Mr Alles’s earlier foundation, the Gateway Institute of Advanced Studies. On opening day the school comprised eight teachers and a modest 33 pupils. Enrolments accelerated rapidly, causing Gateway to erect its first purpose-designed building on First Lane, off Gothami Road. The primary school was later extended by procuring and developing the adjacent block of land; the entire complex came to be known as Millennium Tower on account of it having been completed in 2000. But student numbers kept growing; and in 2002 it was found necessary to move the Foundation classes to a new location on Castle Street, Colombo. </p>

		<p>At its inception, the secondary division of the school offered only A-level classes; the O-level stage was added in short order. More properties in the vicinity had to be acquired to accommodate the swift expansion of both the primary and secondary divisions, adding facilities and substance to the school.</p>

		<h2>Why ‘Gateway’?</h2>
		<p>A name is more than just a label; it is integral to the identity of  the person or institution that bears it. No accident, then, that most  Sri Lankan international schools have names that contain a foreign or cosmopolitan element, often evoking British or Western Classical associations. Ralph Alles would have none of this. But although his school was founded in Sri Lankan culture, neither did he wish to seem to pander to an aggressive form of nationalism. Any name he chose must steer clear of these opposed pitfalls and also convey something of the value of  education, which is essentially to open young minds to new ideas, experiences and prospects and fit them for the life that lies beyond the school portals. Thus: Gateway.</p>
		<p>These implications were embodied in the school’s first motto,  ‘Gateway to Knowledge’. The first school crest, also designed at the same time, depicted a pair of gates opening to reveal, beyond, a shining lamp: a symbolic representation of the motto and of the concept of enlightenment. </p>
		<p>Mr Alles also put a good deal of thought into the names of the school ‘houses’. After considering various possibilities, he opted to use the  forenames of the first four prime ministers of the country. The names of Stephen (Senanayake), Lionel (Kotelawala), Dudley (Senanayake) and Solomon (Dias Bandaranaike) are familiar to all Sri Lankans and have patriotic associations, but are also English names that harmonise with the language of education at Gateway and the ‘international’ character of the school. They also, not coincidentally, make very satisfying chants for spectators at inter-house competitions.</p>
		<h2>Building an international curriculum</h2>
		<p>By the time Gateway College was founded, Sri Lankan parents had evolved well-defined expectations of the curricula and character of  ‘international-school education.’ In reality, however, attributes varied from school to school. There were no ready-made ‘curricular packages’, no standardised syllabuses of the kind that exist for state schools. </p>
		<p>Before finalising a concept and curriculum for Gateway, therefore, Mr Alles and his family conducted extensive research into the subject, consulting with many leading figures in the field of education. One was Goolbai Gunasekara, the illustrious educationist who was the founding principal of Asian International School. Ms Gunasekara provided  valuable advice about the strengths and weaknesses of some of the most popular international programmes on offer. Her insights were developed further by Mr Alles’s son, Harsha, who had taken on the challenge of developing the Gateway curriculum. </p>

		<p>What Dr Harsha Alles sought was an international-school programme covering the whole of the primary and secondary divisions, rather than one focused only on qualifying examinations for higher education.  He had noticed how, when a Sri Lankan international school designed its own programme for non-exam years, issues nearly always arose with the available pedagogical resources; the textbook often became the whole curriculum. What Dr Alles sought instead was a well-developed programme that tracked pupils’ progress via a ‘key stage’ system.  After weighing several options, the one he chose was the English National Curriculum – but it was to be adapted to the ethos and values of Gateway by adding components such as Sinhala and Tamil language, religious studies and Sri Lankan history.   </p>
		<p>Dr Alles also made contact with what was then the University of London Board of Examinations (now Pearson Edexcel), whose famous ‘O-level’ and ‘A-level’ examinations are very familiar to Sri Lankans because they form the template on which the country’s own state-school curricula were developed. Rather than simply offer the latest London O-levels and A-levels, however, Harsha Alles sought the board’s support to set up Gateway’s entire programme. </p>
		<p>A particular priority was teacher training. The London board was at first resistant, but after much persuasion Dr Alles secured the services of a well-known expert in education, Matthew Portal, who first came to  Sri Lanka in 1997 to conduct a training programme for Gateway staff.  A certain chemistry resulted; Mr Portal loved Sri Lanka and found himself greatly in sympathy with the school staff and management.  He would visit Gateway several more times in the years that followed, carrying out more training sessions – sometimes even defraying his own expenses, so enthusiastic was he about the school.</p>
		<h2>A custom-built ICT division</h2>
		<p>Though information and communications technology (ICT) was still something of a latecomer to Sri Lanka, Dr Alles was quick to grasp its importance to our country’s future and drive its development at the school. Gateway was one of the first schools in the country to integrate ICT into the regular menu of subjects offered to pupils. Here, again, the great initial difficulty was to obtain a suitable curriculum. Off-the-shelf options were limited: apart from an expensive American franchise, Futurekids, nothing suitable could be found. The Gateway decision was, therefore, to create a purpose-designed curriculum, taking the ICT syllabus offered in UK schools as a model.</p>

			<p>The school ICT laboratory was launched with two teachers and only two computers. The uptake was extraordinary and the facility grew  rapidly. The Gateway Kids’ School of Computing was founded at the primary school in 1997; lessons were conducted on afternoons and weekends to avoid overlap with the regular curriculum. Reach grew with  demand, extending overseas: at one point, Gateway School of Computing had a presence in twelve countries, serving some 45,000 pupils. </p>
		<p>As Gateway’s ICT teachers became more experienced, they were able to publish material of their own, including teaching guides and software for other schools and students in Sri Lanka and overseas. One landmark achievement was a book on the European Computer Driving License written by Gateway ICT teachers and published in the UK by Nelson Thornes. It was the first time this established academic publisher (since merged with the Oxford University Press) had published a book authored in South Asia. </p>

			<p>ICT is now a well-established economic sector in Sri Lanka.  Gateway continues to invest in ICT education, equipping computer labs and installing new technological aids such as interactive whiteboards. All campuses enjoy full Wi-Fi coverage; pupils regularly use computers in class; teachers are trained in the use of Microsoft tools. By 2021 over a hundred staff were proud holders of Microsoft Innovative Educator Expert awards. At the time of its silver jubilee, Gateway had been a Microsoft Showcase School for six consecutive years. Scarcely more than three hundred institutes around the world hold this exclusive accreditation.</p>
		<h2>Leveraging strategic partnerships</h2>
		<p>This ethos of building and improving the school’s offer to pupils and parents through the use of strategic partnerships with established,  reputable service providers, examination boards and others has continued to be a hallmark of Gateway’s approach to this day. From the retention of leading educationists to its relationships with Pearson Edexcel, Cambridge International, SACE International and others, partnership is always the preferred way forward.</p>

		<p>In 2021, with ICT assuming critical importance thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gateway came together with Dialog Axiata PLC to host the first ever Sri Lankan InnovaThon – an app-making competition that challenged tech-savvy Gateway pupils to develop their own, workable tech-based solutions to pressing social and environmental problems. In addition to awards and certificates, contestants also  received non-financial support such as training, mentoring and coaching from Dialog. In recognition of these efforts in ICT, Gateway was named a ‘DigiEdu Model School’ by Dialog and an ‘EdTech Specialist School’ by Sri Lanka Telecom.  </p>
	   
	   
		<p>This year, the College is making preparations to launch the  Gateway-Oxford Maths Olympiad, a new initiative designed to popularise mathematics and improve the subject standard among pupils.  Gateway’s partner in this venture is the Oxford University Press, a 600-year-old subsidiary of the famous university. Successful Maths Olympians will receive further training and opportunities to compete in worldwide mathematical competitions and talent exhibitions.</p>
