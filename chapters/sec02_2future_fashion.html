		<p>This model shows the differences in fashion and clothing which might happen in the future. Our model is half ‘Present Human’ and half  ‘Future Human’.</p>
		<p>Future generations will witness many unique fashion ideas which will bring together fashion and technology. Technology is meant to make life easier for all, disregarding all barriers that divide humans. We have made our Future Human a symbol of all that removes these barriers. The objects that we have placed outside the model’s body are meant to be symbols of what is inside.</p>
		<p>The main thing that we imagine in future fashion is the model’s connection to the world outside the human body through chips that can be injected into the body just after birth, like a normal vaccine. </p>
		<h2>Breaking barriers</h2>
		<p><span><strong>Present Human:</strong>  Humans get divided into groups of people who are abled and disabled. <span><strong>Future Human:</strong>  In our Future Human we have shown a symbolic machine that connects the heart to the outside world. This will help the Future Human do all sorts of activities even if they have disabilities. This special chip is inserted into the body at birth and spreads through the whole body through the blood pumped from the heart, releasing a special chemical which makes the body capable of doing different activities. Breaking barriers is the theme of our Future Human.</p>

		<h2>Makeup and clothing</h2>
		<p><strong>Present Human:</strong> Makeup in the present world only helps to change and beautify a person’s looks. The production of makeup pollutes the  environment, too. <strong>Future Human:</strong> The makeup of Future Human not only beautifies, but also helps overcome  disabilities, making the world more accessible to all. For example, our Future Human wears eye shadow that works as an eye lens for a person who is blind. They also wear a lip colour that helps people with speaking disabilities. The painted face of the Future Human is a symbol of this futuristic lipstick and eye  shadow. However, wearing these products does not show a person’s  disabilities, because even an abled person could wear the same makeup for beautification. The purpose of the makeup is not seen on the outside. The Future Human will not feel that their disabilities limit them because their technologically developed fashion will help them work better. The makeup is also environmentally friendly. First, none of the products are tested on living beings so that none of them end up endangered. Second, a very limited amount of plant raw material is used so that plants do not go extinct. As a bonus, the makeup will also have the ability to change colour when you put your finger on it and think of the look  you would like. This is also because of the microchips in the Future  Human’s body.</p>
		
		<h2>PRACTICALITY</h2>
		<p><strong>Present Human:</strong> Present fashions are hard to wear and take off. Hair styles are complex and irritating. Fashionable clothes are uncomfortable. <strong>Future Human:</strong>The Future Human’s hair can be changed into any different comfortable style with a simple pull of a strand of hair. The artificial body chips make it possible for the Future Human to change the look of an item of clothing or accessory with a simple touch on that part of the body. The little bulb on the Future Human’s knee is an implant which allows them to instantly change the bottom clothing item into a color and shape they like. They can choose to wear a lovely pair of jeans that helps them with difficulties in movement. The silver band on the Future Human’s arm does the same with the top half of the body. They can choose a fashionable blouse that helps an armless person work. The crown-like item that is on the head is what makes it possible for the Future Human to change the colour and shape of the fashion accessories they are wearing. They can choose a pair of earrings that helps them hear better.</p>
	
		<h2>APPROACHING DANGER</h2>
		<p><strong>Present Human:</strong>  In the present world, there are so many instances where people become dangerous and harm each other. There are also simple instances where there are inconvenient things lying around.  <strong>Future Human :</strong>   The Future Human will be able to guard themselves with the very fashionable pair of shoes that we have used on our model. These shoes warn of approaching danger and activate the Future Human’s feet. They also sense any object lying on the floor that might hurt the Future Human and will prevent them from stepping on an inconvenient object. </p>
		<h2>THE GLOBE</h2>
		<p><strong>Present Human :</strong>   Half of the globe shows the present world which is becoming increasingly more polluted.  <strong>Future Human :</strong>   The Future Human, with all their technology, creates a world which feels and looks much better. The Future Human lives in a world where there are no physical and bodily barriers. That is why our Future Human holds a globe which is of a single gold color. There are no differences in how and where people live. There will only be beauty which will help every Future Human to color the world with their unique taste. They choose all types of clothing and makeup looks which help them overcome their difficulties without displaying any difference between people who are abled and people who are disabled. </p>
		<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
		<p>Our aim in imagining our Future Human is to make the world a friendlier and more beautiful place to all Future Humans through technology merged with fashion. Our model of the Future Human versus the Present Human symbolises a world where all Future Humans are happy, comfortable, confident about themselves, and respectful of nature.</p>
