		<p>Sophia had made up her mind. After five years, she was going to get her neural net removed. The millions of nanobots in her brain had given her life back to her, by helping her mind to work again. They had done their job. It was time to get them out.</p>
		<p>Sophia was a 23-year-old girl who was brought to the emergency room by the campus police of the college from which she had been suspended several months ago.</p>
		<p>Sophia was found to be a poorly groomed young girl who seemed inattentive and preoccupied. Her family said that they had never known her to use drugs or alcohol. She did not want to eat the meal offered by the hospital staff and voiced concern that they might be trying to hide drugs in her food. She used to be very close to her mother, whose recent demise had shaken Sophia from the roots. Her father and sister claimed that the sudden change in Sophia’s behaviour was a result of the bereavement of her mother’s death. Upon persuasion of her father and sister, Sophia consented to check herself into a local psychiatric unit.</p>
		<p>Her story reflects a common case in which a high-functioning young adult goes through a major decline in day-to-day skills. In Sophia’s case, she was having persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, and  negative symptoms that had lasted for at least a year. She was immediately assigned a VR session where automated algorithms processed the  emotions in her face and changes in her voice to quantify the negative symptoms, which confirmed her diagnosis of schizophrenia.</p>
		<p>Seeing her debilitating state, the psychiatrist insisted on Sophia seeing a Neuroprosthetic surgeon. He felt that treating her symptoms on the  onset would give a permanent cure and allow her to return to normal life  much faster.</p>
		<p>Sophia was immediately transferred to the Institute for Neuroprosthetics, a low-slung brick building in the suburbs of Chicago. Inside, Sophia barely listened as the clinic coordinator described the technology again. An injection would deliver the nanobots to her blood. Then a technician would guide the bots, using a magnet, from her arm toward her head. A fast, strong pulse of ultrasound would open the blood-brain barrier temporarily, allowing an army of minuscule particles to slip in. Powered by the molecular motion inherent in the brain, the nanobots would spread out to form a web of microscopic electrodes. That neural network could pinpoint where Sophia’s brain circuitry was misfiring and repair it with precise but persuasive electrical nudges.</p>
		<p>Over the weeks after the injection, Sophia’s nanobots learned the  neural rhythms of her brain as she moved through her life with debilitating psychosis. With powerful computational help – and regular  tinkering by the clinic technologist – the system soon learned to spot the earliest neural rumblings of a deteriorating mood. Once those warning signs were clear, Sophia’s web of nanobots could end budding episodes  before they could take her down.</p>
		<p>Sophia seemed to be coming back to her normal self, though sometimes she seemed to be too normal. She recalls the day she went to a seminar at her college. In the middle of the lectures, Sophia’s squawks of laughter silenced the entire auditorium. She still remembers the look on her chief doctor’s face.</p>
		<p>After a few months and some adjustments, Sophia’s emotions evened out. The numb, cold depression was gone. Gone too were the inappropriate bursts of laughter, flashes of white rage, and insatiable appetites. She was able to settle in with her family, and feel – really feel – the joy of it all.</p>
		<p>But was this joy hers alone? Maybe it belonged to the army of tiny, ever-vigilant helpers, reworking her brain. Without her neural net, she might have been confined to her room, giving in to the darkness that was consuming her. Instead, Sophia proudly walked on to the stage to receive her medical degree, feeling only slightly wistful, nothing more intense than that. She was now a fully accredited Neuroprosthetic surgeon.</p>
		<p>The science supporting the success of neural nets was staggering.  They could efficiently fix huge problems: addiction, dementia, eating disorders, and more. But science couldn’t answer bigger questions of  identity and control – what it means to be a person.</p>
		<p>That search for herself is what drove Sophia back to the clinic, five years after she welcomed the nanobots in. Her technologist goes over the  simple extraction procedure: a quick ultrasound pulse to loosen the blood-brain barrier again, a strong magnet over the inside of Sophia’s elbow, and a blood draw.</p>
		<p>He looks at her. “You ready?”</p>
		<p>She takes a deep breath. “Yes.”</p>
	
		<p class="text-align-center pt-3 pb-3" >***</p>
	
		<h2>REALITY CHECK</h2>
		<p>In this story, Sophia undergoes therapy that does not exist in the actual world. However, the concept that scientists would be able to modify  certain brain networks – and thereby enhance health – is not fiction. It is taking place.</p>
		<p>Deep brain stimulation, or DBS, is a technology that already employs electrodes surgically placed in people’s brains to modify the activity of brain cells. These electrode implants are assisting in the reduction of Parkinson’s tremors, epileptic seizures, and Tourette’s syndrome-induced uncontrolled movements.</p>
		<p>The experience of VR triggers the same psychological and physiological reactions as real-life situations, meaning that what people learn from VR stays with them in the real world. We believe these digital phenotyping variables may predict risk in a much more sophisticated way than what we can get through the traditional clinical rating scales.</p>
		<p>Today’s scientists know a lot more about how to specifically impact brain activity than they did back then. However, before a therapy like Sophia’s can be implemented, three key obstacles must be overcome: Doctors need improved tools – agile and powerful systems that can function consistently within the brain for years. They need to know where to target the therapy in the brain. Finally, a breakthrough in technology – if a phone could help monitor their symptoms and prevent them from having to return for frequent clinical re-evaluations, that represents a new level in using technology for mental health care. This position varies across illnesses and even between individuals.</p>
		<p>These are significant issues, but the numerous components required for this type of precise healing are beginning to come together.</p>
