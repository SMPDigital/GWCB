		<p>Education the world over was thrown into disarray by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. When the Sri Lankan government declared an island-wide lockdown in March 2020, schools across the country had to make an immediate transition to virtual education – something in which few had any prior experience. The challenge was immense. </p>
		<p>At Gateway College, where ICT already featured strongly in the  academic and administrative routing, the shift was more or less seamless. By the time the pandemic struck, Gateway had already been a Microsoft Showcase School for four consecutive years. Platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Skype in the Classroom, Sway, Forms and OneNote were thoroughly familiar to pupils and teachers alike. Students from Year 3 upwards were already equipped with licensed Office 365 suites as part of their learning materials. </p>

				<p>In early 2020, while the world was still coming to terms with the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic, Gateway rolled out a hybrid learning programme that integrated traditional, ‘flipped’, ‘blended’, remote and e-learning components. Thus, when the first lockdown was imposed in Sri Lanka, the infrastructure required to support virtual learning was firmly in place. Long familiarity with the technology ensured that teachers and students alike were able to navigate and function comfortably in the digital space. Creativity, teachers found, was the key to keeping pupils fully engaged during online school sessions. Instruction was interspersed with games, quizzes and stories that were enjoyed by teachers and pupils alike.</p>
		<p>In tandem with the process of digitising student learning through the pandemic, teacher-related information processing was also automated and centralised. A new performance-management portal (PMP) was launched in 2020, streamlining data on teachers and making  record-keeping more efficient. The all-in-one PMP platform now  records the performance of teachers biannually and features systems for performance appraisal, lesson observation and maintaining professional development records.</p>
		<p>And despite the challenges of the pandemic, professional development for teachers remained a priority. All staff were able to virtually attend two major conferences: the World Education Summit and the Microsoft E2 Conference.  </p>

		<h2>Simulating school life </h2>
		<p>During this time, Gateway staff also took pains to reproduce or simulate as much of the full school experience as possible. A weekly home-room session gave students and teachers the opportunity to socialise and connect much as they would do in a physical classroom. The VSAK programme was successfully transferred online so that pupils could continue to acquire valuable life skills. </p>
		<p>All over the world, it was physical education that suffered most in the pandemic. Acutely aware of the issue, Gateway took steps to compensate for this inevitable effect as far as possible. Events and extracurricular activities were held virtually (such as virtual Avurudu, Vesak and Christmas carols), maintaining as regular a schedule as circumstances would allow. Sports teachers and coaches devised ways for their charges to practise and hone their skills at home; coaching sessions were held using various video conferencing tools. Since regular events and fixtures were out of the question, a ‘virtual festival of sports’ (V-FoS) was held in October 2021. Each individual competitor or team was given a set of relevant challenges to attempt, on camera. The videos thus created were uploaded on Flipgrid for viewing and judging by the coaches and other competitors.</p>

				<h2>Reaching out to the less fortunate  </h2>
		<p>The exponential increase in coronavirus cases during the ‘waves’ of 2020 put enormous strain on Sri Lanka’s hospitals. There were delays in testing, too, due to a shortage of resources. Gateway did what it could both to ease the pressure on hospitals and to speed up the testing and reporting process. The school’s directors presented a state-of-the-art PCR machine to the Department of Immunology &amp; Molecular Medicine at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, while students, staff and past pupils raised funds to purchase and donate a thousand test kits. The College also contributed a hydrogen-peroxide vapour fogger, a device used in treating Covid-19 patients, to the Colombo South Hospital. In a gesture of gratitude towards the exemplary contribution of the nation’s public-health inspectors, gift packs were distributed to dozens of PHIs and their families. These actions exemplified the determination of the Gateway community to do all it could for our country and people in a time of extreme need.</p>
		<h2>A glorious team effort </h2>
		<p>There is no denying that the pandemic presented Gateway with enormous difficulties. The dedication and support of administrative and teaching staff were, in the end, what pulled the College through. From the moment Sri Lanka went into lockdown, everyone pulled together, not stinting with their help and support. In the absence of face-to-face contact, the frequency of staff meetings increased so that communications could be kept open and a sense of community maintained. Heads of departments and school principals were in constant touch with teachers, encouraging, motivating and showing appreciation.</p>
		<p>No matter how stern the challenge before them, the staff of Gateway College have always upheld the highest possible standards of teaching and learning. Better still, this has been achieved while maintaining a positive outlook, demonstrating the generosity and commitment that define the Gateway spirit. </p>
