		<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">Though Gateway College was founded in 1997, its story really begins with the career of the eminent educationist Ralph Ignatius Thomas Alles, better known professionally as R.I.T. Alles. Himself an alumnus of two great Roman Catholic private schools, St. Aloysius’ College, Galle, and St. Anthony’s College, Kandy, Mr Alles began his teaching career at the country’s leading state boys’ school, Royal College, which is famed as a nursery of Sri Lankan political leaders, administrators, cultural figures and professionals. It was a challenging environment for a novice teacher, but Mr Alles quickly demonstrated his ability both in the classroom and as master-in-charge of the college cadet troop, itself the oldest formation of its kind in the country. </p>
		<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">He soon won the trust of his superiors at Royal College, among them the principal, Bogoda Premaratne. In the mid-sixties, when it became necessary to start another superior boys’ school in Colombo to reduce the pressure on admissions at Royal, Mr Premaratne was tasked by the Ministry of Education to nominate a suitable head teacher for the new establishment. Ralph Alles was his immediate choice.</p>
		<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">Mr Alles himself knew nothing of it. When the call came from the Minister of Education, the young teacher was alarmed. He had lately been involved in trade-union action and assumed that he was being summoned to receive a reprimand and a punitive transfer. When he had recovered from his surprise and relief at learning this was not the case, he was only too willing to accept the minister’s commission. </p>

		<p>The site selected for the new school was a parcel of waste ground, dotted with termite-mounds, in an otherwise highly desirable part of Colombo. At this time the school was still being thought of as an extension of Royal College and Mr Alles was able to enlist the help of his cadets to clear and level the ground. Construction of what would come to be known as D.S. Senanayake College began soon afterwards. When it finally opened its doors in 1967, it did so under the principalship of R.I.T. Alles. Mr Alles strived to create an inclusive, multi-ethnic and multi-religious culture at ‘DSS’, and over the next decade, the school grew and flourished. In the early 1980s he was awarded a scholarship by the Canadian government to study vocational education, in the course of which he visited training establishments in fourteen countries. He planned to establish a vocational training department at D.S. Senanayake College, but on his return to Sri Lanka, he discovered that, as a result of political manoeuvring, he had been removed as principal of DSS in absentia and transferred to the Curriculum Development Division of the ministry. Deprived of scope to exercise his vocation, Mr Alles temporarily left the state sector, joining Zahira College as Director of Studies in 1983. There he spent three years, winning the hearts of pupils, colleagues and parents.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, the vast private-tuition industry that had mushroomed as an organic response to the troubles of the state system of education continued to flourish. Ralph Alles decided that until the public system could be comprehensively reformed, private education was where the future lay. Resigning from Zahira in 1986, he opened a small academic institute to prepare students for both local and University of London O-level and A-level examinations, the latter of which are recognised as entry qualifications by institutes of higher education in many parts of the world. Based at a converted private residence at Rodney Street, Borella, the Gateway Institute of Advanced Studies was an immediate success. Recognising its potential for growth, he mortgaged his own home to buy out Gateway’s other investors.</p>

		<p>Ralph Alles was reinstated as Principal of D.S. Senanayake College in March 1989. His wife Rohini and son Harsha, at this time a medical student, took over the day-to-day running of the Institute. Mrs Alles, who, like her husband, had been a teacher at Royal and later the founding deputy principal of President’s College, Kotte, was fully equipped for the challenge, boasting nearly fifty years of teaching and administrative experience. Until her husband retired fully from state service in 1995 and again focused his remarkable talents and energies on Gateway, she showed herself to be an excellent manager and head teacher.</p>
		<h2>A different kind of international school</h2>
		<p>Schools for the children of wealthy expatriates have always existed. Local examples include the colonial-era Hill School in Nuwara Eliya and the Colombo School for Overseas Children (now called the Overseas School of Colombo), founded in 1957, in Colombo.</p>
		<p>The Kodai School in Tamil Nadu, India, was another such school. In 1971, however, it was redeveloped under a new  concept,  accepting Indian as well as foreign entrants but preparing them for international examinations outside the Indian state system. Thus was born, in South Asia at least, the modern ‘international school’. When the  Sri Lankan government began to permit the establishment of new private schools under the Companies Act in the late seventies, the concept immediately became popular. Capable school-leavers with the necessary resources had long sought higher education abroad; institutions that could help them acquire the necessary secondary qualifications to do so now came to be in high demand.</p>
		<p>Now retired from state education, Ralph Alles was able to devote his energies to building his fledgling school – and he had a clear vision of the kind of school he wanted to build. A lifelong patriot who strove hard to inculcate a similar patriotism in the young people under his care, he had noticed that international-school pupils tended to be very much at ease with Western and world culture but, in his opinion, lacked understanding of and sympathy for their own Sri Lankan roots. Many grew up in an elitist bubble, disconnected from their own neighbours and communities. He concluded that what was needed was a school that taught an internationally accepted curriculum and maintained international pedagogical standards, but held close to the Sri Lankan cultural soil in which it was founded.</p>

		<p>It was not at all certain that a market for such a school existed.  The appeal of international schools was only partly due to the type and quality of education they provided; they were also status symbols, and to have a child at one of them was a signal to one’s contemporaries that one had ‘arrived’. In the hierarchy of Sri Lankan international schools, it was the ones with the most expatriates on the student body, the most European or American staff members, the most high-tech academic and extracurricular facilities – such as computers in the classroom and gymnasiums filled with expensive equipment – that occupied the topmost levels. Children attending these schools were expected to move on to higher education overseas and, upon graduation, land lucrative jobs in their countries of adoption. If they returned to Sri Lanka at all, it would be in middle age or retirement, once they had made their names and fortunes abroad. To attend one of these schools was, for a child, to be already in some sense an expatriate.</p>
		<p>Ralph Alles and a few others recognized, however, that a large group of Sri Lankans existed for whom such aspirations held no relevance. These were not people born to wealth, or hailing from old-elite backgrounds that assured their social success. They were salaried employees, middle or senior managers, private entrepreneurs and others who had raised themselves to a level of affluence that gave them enough money for discretionary spending, and yearned to see their children securely and comfortably established. They were responsive to the status appeal of international schools but did not wish their sons and daughters to grow deracinated and forgetful of their origins. Here, within this group, lay a reservoir of untapped opportunity. What they needed was an English-medium school with international curricula and standards, but a social and pastoral culture that was Sri Lankan to the heart. Thus was born the Gateway school concept.</p>
		<h2>Close to his heart</h2>
		<p>To say that Mr Alles was respected among his peers is an understatement. Ever since his time at Royal College, his reputation had continued to grow. The early success of D.S. Senanayake College was due in large measure to him. After his reinstatement as head of DSS in 1989, he was rapidly promoted to the post of State Secretary of Education, the highest administrative position in the national education bureaucracy.</p>
		<p>Scores of parents have cited Mr Alles as the main reason for choosing to enrol their children at Gateway. This was notably the case during the early years, for although the school was new, Mr Alles was a renowned figure. Many teachers, too, applied for posts at Gateway in order to have the opportunity of enjoying his mentorship. It was a privilege, they believed, to learn from him. </p>
		<p>Mr Alles threw himself body and soul into setting up Gateway, working tirelessly to ensure the school’s success. Even in his latter years, after Gateway was well established, he continued to make regular visits to all its branches though he was now confined to a wheelchair. A role model for educators and an example of dedicated and responsible conduct to students and parents alike, Ralph Alles has left an indelible mark not just on Gateway but on the educational landscape of our country. </p>
