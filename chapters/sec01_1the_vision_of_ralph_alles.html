    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">Though Gateway College was founded in 1997, its story really begins with the career of the eminent educationist Ralph Ignatius Thomas Al-les, better known professionally as R.I.T. Alles. Himself an alumnus of two great Roman Catholic private schools, St. Aloysius’ College, Galle, and St. Anthony’s College, Kandy, Mr Alles began his teaching career at the country’s leading state boys’ school, Royal College, which is famed as a nursery of Sri Lankan political leaders, administrators, cultural figures and professionals. It was a challenging environment for a novice teacher, but Mr Alles quickly demonstrated his ability both in the classroom and as master-in-charge of the college cadet troop, itself the oldest formation of its kind in the country. </p>
                                    
                                    
<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">He soon won the trust of his superiors at Royal College, among them the principal, Bogoda Premaratne. In the mid-Sixties, when it became necessary to start another superior boys’ school in Colombo to reduce the pressure on admissions at Royal, Mr Premaratne was tasked by the Ministry of Education to nominate a suitable head teacher for the new establishment. Ralph Alles was his immediate choice.</p>
                                    
                                    
<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">Mr Alles himself knew nothing of it. When the call came from the Minister of Education, the young teacher was alarmed. He had late-ly been involved in trade-union action and assumed that he was being summoned to receive a reprimand and a punitive transfer. When he had recovered from his surprise and relief at learning this was not the case, he was only too willing to accept the minister’s commission. </p>

<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">The site selected for the new school was a parcel of waste ground, dotted with termite-mounds, in an otherwise highly desirable part of Co-lombo. At this time the school was still being thought of as an extension of Royal College and Mr Alles was able to enlist the help of his cadets to clear and level the ground. Construction of what would come to be known as D.S. Senanayake College began soon afterwards. When it fi-nally opened its doors in 1967, it did so under the principalship of R.I.T. Alles. Mr Alles strived to create an inclusive, multi-ethnic and multi-re-ligious culture at ‘DSS’, and over the next decade, the school grew and flourished. In the early 1980s he was awarded a scholarship by the Cana-dian government to study vocational education, in the course of which he visited training establishments in fourteen countries. He planned to establish a vocational training department at D.S. Senanayake College, but on his return to Sri Lanka, he discovered that, as a result of politi-cal manoeuvring, he had been removed as principal of DSS in absentia and transferred to the Curriculum Development Division of the minis-try. Deprived of scope to exercise his vocation, Mr Alles temporarily left the state sector, joining Zahira College as Director of Studies in 1983. There he spent three years, winning the hearts of pupils, colleagues and parents.     </p>

<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">Meanwhile, the vast private-tuition industry that had grown up as an
organic response to the troubles of the state system of education continued
to flourish. Ralph Alles decided that until the public system could be
comprehensively reformed, private education was where the future lay.
Resigning from Zahira in 1986, he opened a small academic institute to
prepare students for both local and University of London O- and A-level
examinations, the latter of which are recognized as entry qualifications
by institutes of higher education in many parts of the world. Based at a
converted private residence at Rodney Street, the Gateway Institute of
Advanced Studies was an immediate success. Recognizing the potential
for growth, he mortgaged his own home to buy out Gateway’s other investors.   </p>

<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">Ralph Alles was reinstated as Principal of D.S. Senanayake College
in March 1989. His wife Rohini and son Harsha, at this time a medical
student, took over the day-to-day running of the Institute. Mrs Alles,
who, like her husband, had been a teacher at Royal and later the
founding deputy principal of President’s College, was fully equipped for
the challenge, boasting nearly fifty years of teaching and administrative
experience. Until her husband retired fully from state service in 1995
and again focused his remarkable talents and energies on Gateway, she
showed herself to be an excellent manager and head teacher.    </p>

<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">                    Schools for the children of wealthy expatriates have always existed. Local
examples include the colonial-era Hill School at Nuwara Eliya and the
Colombo School for Overseas Children (now called the Overseas School
of Colombo), founded in 1957, in Colombo.  </p>             
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">The Kodai School near Madras (now Chennai), India, was another
such school. In 1971, however, it was redeveloped under a new concept,
accepting Indian as well as foreign entrants but preparing them for international
examinations outside the Indian state system. Thus was born,
in South Asia at least, the modern ‘international school’. When the Sri
Lankan government began to permit the establishment of new private
schools under the Companies Act in the late Seventies, the concept immediately
became popular. Capable school-leavers with the necessary resources
had long sought higher education abroad; institutions that could
help them acquire the necessary secondary qualifications to do so now
came to be in high demand.</p>
<p class="has-animation" data-delay="400">Now retired from state education, Ralph Alles was able to devote his
energies to building his fledgling school – and he had a clear vision of the
kind of school he wanted to build. A lifelong patriot who strove hard to
inculcate a similar patriotism in the young people under his care, he had
noticed that international-school pupils tended to be very much at ease
with Western and world culture but, in his opinion, lacked understanding
of and sympathy for their own Sri Lankan roots. Many grew up in an
elitist bubble, disconnected from their own neighbours and communities.
He concluded that what was needed was a school that taught an internationally
accepted curriculum and maintained international pedagogical
standards, but held close to the Sri Lankan cultural soil in which it was
founded.    </p>
