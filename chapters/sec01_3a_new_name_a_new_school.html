		<p>By 2005, Gateway International School had counted eight successful years. In addition to the parent school, thriving branches had also been set up in Kandy and Bambalapitiya. The school had earned a distinguished reputation for academic achievement and pastoral care. </p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the international-school concept had become a victim of its own success. Striving to emulate what Gateway and a handful of others had accomplished, a host of business establishments of questionable type and quality had sprung up, all calling themselves ‘international schools’. Some of these operations offered neither English education nor curricula that supported any internationally recognised qualification. Some barely provided any kind of education at all. Their emergence had the effect of generally devaluing public perceptions regarding international schools.</p>

				<p>At Gateway, meanwhile, the term was becoming something of a  misnomer. The school had now found its roots in Sri Lankan culture and the ‘international’ tag no longer fit it quite so well. </p>
		<p>For these and other reasons, Gateway International School changed its name to Gateway College in 2005. In Sri Lanka, the word ‘college’  has in any case tended to refer to a ‘collegiate school’ such as Royal College or Bishop’s College rather than a university. The term was particularly appropriate to Gateway, which no longer confined itself to school-level curricula but had recently begun to offer degree-credit programmes from a number of foreign universities.</p>
		<p>The expression ‘college’ conjures up an image of a purpose-built campus equipped with residential facilities. Although it is, like all other Gateway branches, a day school, Gateway College Kandy nevertheless fit the description well. Unfortunately, the same could not be said of the Gothami Road and Rodney Street premises, where there were no playing fields and other amenities and the primary and secondary divisions of the school were separately located in converted houses. </p>

		<h2>The College coalesces</h2>
		<p>A three-acre site suitable for the school was available at Koswatte Road in Rajagiriya, the Colombo suburb nearest the Gothami/Rodney Street premises of Gateway. The asking price, however, was more than the school’s financial resources (and bank credit) could cover. Traditionally, schools raise funds for buildings and improvements by appealing to parents, but Ralph Alles had never taken this route. Now the time had come. He invited groups of prospective donors among his pupils’ parents to view the property, outlining his plans and appealing for an interest-free loan. While specifying the sum needed, he was careful to add that each parent was free to decide how much they wished to contribute. The money was soon forthcoming and in 2005, amid much excitement and celebration, Gateway College Colombo was declared open. </p>
		<p>The relocation of the school was carried out in two phases. The secondary division moved first, with the primary school following the next year. Somabandhu Kodikara, who had been headmaster at  Rodney Street since 2001, became the first Principal of Gateway College  Colombo. He continued to give excellent leadership to the school until his retirement in 2010. </p>
		<p>Acquisition of adjoining properties expanded the footprint of the College by about 50 percent and allowed for the building of a well-equipped sports complex and a dedicated technology-studies facility. Harshana Perera, principal from 2012 to 2017, presided over this rapid phase of expansion. He was succeeded in 2017 by Vinita Shenoy, whose particular focus is student well-being and under whom the College and its pupils continue to grow and thrive.</p>
		<p>In keeping with the Sri Lankan cultural ethos that distinguishes  it from other international schools, Gateway has succeeded in  forging relationships with other superior Colombo schools, both  state and private, within the national system of education. The  year 2018 saw the initiation of two annual sporting events, the  Alles-Gunasekara Basketball Trophy with Royal College and the Marie Musaeus-Rohini Alles Netball Challenge Trophy with Musaeus College.  A third series, the Neville de Alwis-Ralph Alles Football Challenge  Trophy, was instituted with S. Thomas’ College in 2019. These matches with top sporting schools take Gateway pupils beyond the comfort-zone of international-school competition, where the bar of achievement is not quite so high. They have also allowed Gateway students to benefit from exposure to the ethos and traditions of these old-established and highly regarded Sri Lankan schools.</p>

		<h2>To energise, enlighten &amp; empower</h2>
		<p>In making the transition from ‘international school’ to ‘college’,  Gateway reaffirms its Sri Lankan roots and signals, also, its commitment to upholding the highest standards in education.</p>
		<p>In keeping with this transformation, the old school crest was replaced by a more appropriate blazon representing the essential qualities of the school. The shield is quartered in blue and grey, the school colours, red standing for power and energy, and white for purity. The two lions symbolise bravery and Sri Lankan heritage; the golden eagle is the school’s highest award in sport. The globe and arrow represent, respectively, international education and technological proficiency, while the book depicts knowledge and the torch denotes enlightenment. Three interlocking squares stand for the bonds between parents, teachers and students; the orange, green and maroon of the diagonals are a nod to the three main communities in Sri Lanka, demonstrating the multi-ethnic and multi-religious harmony within the school.</p>
		<p>It was at this time, too, that the school created its vision and  mission statements. The tricolon ‘Energise, Enlighten, Empower’ of the  vision statement sums up the Gateway philosophy of providing holistic education: energising with a healthy body, enlightening with a healthy mind and empowering all to be good citizens.  This is supported by the mission statement, which covers the four main tenets of the College:  (i) adding value; (ii) tenacity and zeal; (iii) education for tomorrow, and (iv) community of spirit.</p>
