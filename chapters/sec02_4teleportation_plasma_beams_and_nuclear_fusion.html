		<p>The main problem of the current transportation system is traffic  congestion. This problem persists in every major city. As soon as you leave home in the morning to travel to your school or workplace, you are met with the daily nightmare of congested roads with traffic jammed to a standstill. It might take you a staggering amount of time to travel a few kilometres, leading to many invaluable hours of your life being wasted on these roads. What could be a solution to this? An obvious solution would be to reorganise the motorway system, with well-planned roads, logical traffic lights, tunnels, flyovers, metros, overhead monorails, etc. However, it would be close to impossible to completely reorganise the motorway network of any highly populated country, and the costs of this would be immense. But what if there was a different, more interesting, more futuristic solution? What if you could teleport from place to place? </p>
		<p>Teleportation is essentially physical deconstruction at one point and reconstitution at another point. In other words, a human teleportation would involve the translation of a human into data, which can be transmitted from one location to another, and then reconverted into matter, sort of like a human fax machine. A few years ago, a team of  Chinese scientists led by Ji-Gang Ren reached a milestone along the path to achieving teleportation. They succeeded in teleporting photons from Tibet to a satellite almost 500km away, using a phenomenon called “quantum entanglement”. </p>
		<p>Quantum Entanglement is where a pair of photons are able to simultaneously share the same state, even when separated by vast distances. When the state of one photon is changed, the state of the other photon changes too. This means that utilising this phenomenon, information can be transferred between the two entangled particles. Furthermore, it has been discovered that a third particle can be used to entangle one of the original particles and manipulate the state of the distant particle. Even though this may seem like a small thing, this breakthrough could be used to develop a way to teleport humans. This is further elaborated below.</p>
		<p>In the past, the idea of teleportation was not considered seriously by scientists because it was thought to violate the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, which prevents any measuring or scanning process from extracting all the information in an atom or other object. According to the uncertainty principle, the more accurately an object is scanned, the more it is disturbed by the scanning process, until it reaches a point where the object’s original state has been completely disrupted without being able to extract sufficient information to make a perfect replica. This means that a perfect copy of an object cannot be made, so it cannot be reconstituted in another location. This would mean that teleportation is impossible. </p>
		<p>However, a group of scientists later found a way to work around this. They found a way to scan out part of the information from an object A, which is the object which should be teleported, while causing the remaining, unscanned, part of the information to pass, via something called the Einstein-Rosen effect, into another object C, which has never been in contact with A. This allows a perfect copy of a human to be made, which can then be transmitted from one location to another, and then reconstituted at that location. </p>
		<p>In simple terms, during the teleportation process, a human would be perfectly scanned and converted to data. This data packet would be encrypted and beamed into space, bounced around a satellite network, and then beamed to a quantum computer in another location to be unpacked and reconstituted. To transmit this data, X-Rays could be used, which have very short wavelengths and high frequencies and can carry 1 million times more data than normal optical fibre. </p>
		<p>However, to teleport a human, a vast amount of energy is needed. This is because a human has about 31.2 trillion more cells than there are stars in the known universe. According to a study by the University of Leicester, the computing power required to break down into data and then teleport a human being equates to around 2.6 x 10<span>42</span> bits. This would require tremendous bandwidth and roughly 10 trillion gigawatt hours of power. </p>
		<p>The solution to this energy problem could be provided by fusion. Fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei combine to form one or more different atomic nuclei and often subatomic particles as well. The fusion of light elements releases energy due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the nuclear force which holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, and the coulomb force, which causes positively charged protons to repel each other. These bonds within atoms are extremely strong, so breaking these bonds will release a large amount of energy. Therefore, nuclear fuels offer vastly higher energy density than chemical methods – about a million times denser than fossil fuels. Once harnessed, fusion has the potential to be a nearly unlimited, safe, and carbon dioxide free  energy source. </p>
		<p>On the sun, the process of fusion is driven by the Sun’s immense gravitational force and scorching temperatures. However, the Earth does not have a high enough gravitational force required to confine the hydrogen nuclei, so fusion does not occur naturally. </p>
		<p>In order to achieve fusion on Earth, two hydrogen isotopes (deuterium and tritium) need to be heated to extremely high temperatures of about 150 million degrees Celsius, which is around 10 times warmer than the  temperatures in the Sun’s core. Fusion scientists have developed  methods that are able to heat plasma to such temperatures, however, there is no Earthly material that can contain plasmas at such inconceivable temperatures. Therefore, fusion scientists have developed a  magnetic ‘cage’ to confine the plasma. This magnetic ‘cage’ is made by strong magnetic fields which prevent the particles from escaping. For  energy production, this plasma has to be confined for an adequately long period for fusion to occur. The day that scientists develop the  technology necessary to contain the plasma for a long time may not be far away, and when fusion energy is fully harnessed, it can be used to power the teleportation process.</p>

		<p>So how would we incorporate teleportation into our day to day lives? How would we incorporate it into our public transport system as an alternative to buses and trains? We could have several teleportation stations equipped with quantum computers at different locations around cities, sort of like bus stops or train stations. So, if a person wants to travel to their office, they leave home, walk to the nearest teleportation station (which would ideally be only a few minutes away), be deconstructed and then transmitted to the teleportation station nearest to their office. This would reduce the need for buses and cars, so the roads would be significantly cleared of traffic. This would benefit the environment because there will be a substantial reduction in the carbon emissions released to the atmosphere. Furthermore, teleportation would be an instantaneous process, so there would be no queues at teleportation stations. If a large network of such teleportation stations were built up across the world, travel would become extremely interesting and convenient.</p>
		<p>Another aspect of the future of transport is space travel. Space  exploration refers to investigation of the universe beyond the Earth’s  atmosphere, and the use of information so gained to increase knowledge of cosmos and benefit humanity. On 4th October 1957, the USSR launched  Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. The first animal in space  was the dog Laika, aboard the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2, on  3rd November 1957. The first human to travel to space was Soviet  cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who also became the first man to orbit the planet on 12th April 1961 aboard the spacecraft Vostok 1. Even though we have made a lot of advances from the days of the Sputnik launch, we still have a long way to go. Space travel is still very limited in its  capabilities. Therefore, in the future, we would need to develop space systems that are much faster and more cost and energy efficient in order to make space travel mainstream. </p>
		<p>One way to do this is the development of Plasma Beam Space Travel.  Under this concept, a space-based outpost station would generate a high-energy plasma beam aimed at a spaceship equipped with a sail, resulting in it being thrust out into space. In the first phase of its journey, the plasma station would aim bursts of plasma beams at the spaceship over a period of several days to bring the spacecraft to the right speed required for its inter-planetary flight. </p>
		<p>In other words, large power units are placed in permanent orbit around a planet. These power units direct plasma beams at spacecrafts to pull or push them to perform orbital transfers around the planet or to accelerate them to other planets. A plasma station orbiting the destination would decelerate the spaceship, enabling it to land safely. These plasma stations would be fuelled by nuclear power systems or solar-electric power systems.</p>
		<p>Currently, rockets have to carry their propulsion systems on board, which means that the system not only has to move the spacecraft built around it, but it has to move itself too. However, with the plasma beam travel system, the power source is shifted off the spacecraft and onto the plasma stations. According to Professor Robert Winglee of the University of Washington, this sort of spaceship could travel at a speed of  11.7 kilometres per second, making it possible to make a round trip to Mars in three months, and a trip to Jupiter and back in a year. For context, using conventional rocket systems, a round trip to Mars would take about three years.</p>
		<p>With the development of the plasma beam system, in the near future, we may be able to see mainstream space travel. This would result in the gain of a plethora of invaluable knowledge about the Universe, which we can use to understand the origins of the Universe, probe for intelligent extra-terrestrials, possibly predict the future of our universe with much more accuracy, and find new, precious resources for humans to use. With the advent of teleportation, transport could become a hassle free, instantaneous process, the epitome of convenience. As a result of continued research and investment into development of new transport technologies, transport could certainly have a very bright future.</p>
