		<p>In the late Nineties, with Gateway International School fully operational, it was time to consider the question of future growth. The potential catchment for ‘an international school rooted in Sri Lankan culture’ was certainly not confined to Colombo. Many middle-class parents in provincial centres had similar aspirations for their children that were not, as yet, well served.</p>
		<p>Among the few international schools outside Colombo at this time was Kandy International School, one of the first international schools in the country, set up to provide foreign personnel employed on the  Victoria Dam Project with a school for their children. It was located on Riverdale Road, Anniwatte, a Kandy suburb popular with  ‘expats’. When the Victoria project wound up in the late 1980s, Kandy  International lost most of its student body and subsequently began to struggle. It was acquired by Dr Alles in 1999 and renamed Gateway Kandy  International School. The existing employees were absorbed into the Gateway family and continued to serve as before. The incumbent  principal, too, remained in office for the time being.</p>

			<p>In 2001 a new head, Asoka Herath, was appointed. This distinguished educator was a former principal of Dharmaraja College, Kandy, one of the oldest Buddhist schools in the country. Mr Herath immediately won the hearts of staff and pupils alike; his kindly, fatherly approach was just what Gateway Kandy needed. After the death of Ralph Alles in 2013, he became a mainstay of the College, not only for those involved with the Kandy branch but all across the Gateway network.</p>

		<h2>Journey to Asgiriya</h2>
		<p>The school buildings at Riverdale Road premises were modest in size. As the school grew they became seriously cramped, with little room for extracurricular activities and games. A search for more suitable premises ended with the purchase of a tract of bare land at Asgiriya. By 2004, construction of the school buildings had advanced far enough to allow the foundation class to move in; the primary section followed and, with the arrival of the secondary section, the move was complete. It was celebrated in 2010 with a gala school fête featuring carnival rides, a discotheque and a ‘haunted house’. </p>

		<p>In January 2015, one of the main buildings on the site was named the Zakiya Mohomed Building in honour of a well-loved senior staff member who had come to Gateway along with Kandy International. Energetic and spirited, Ms Mohomed had worked unstintingly for the school until her retirement in August 2014. It was the first time Gateway had named a building after one of its teachers.   </p>
		<p>The Gateway Kandy campus has continued to grow over time,  acquiring adjacent and nearby properties and building new facilities. The school’s long-serving and well-loved first principal was honoured in 2021 with the opening of the Asoka Herath Sports Complex, which features a football field, tennis courts, cricket nets and various other amenities. Something new has been added regularly; in 2022, work was under way on a swimming pool. </p>
		<h2>Integrating with the community</h2>
		<p>Like its sister schools in Colombo, Gateway Kandy was an immediate success. That success has endured. The school’s student body had grown from four hundred at the turn of the century to 1,300 by 2021 and the school,  today, employs some two hundred staff. Mr Herath retired in 2016 to take up a position on the school board and, together with his successor, Gladwin Canagasabey, has continued to drive the reputation and success of the Kandy branch. </p>
		<p>Gateway Kandy took the opportunity provided by its twentieth  anniversary in 2020 to foster closer bonds with the other Kandy schools. A series of sporting events was instituted: the R.I.T. Alles-Ireland  Jones Football Challenge Trophy with Trinity College, the Asoka  Herath-Ranil Meetiyagoda Basketball Challenge Trophy with St  Sylvester’s College and the Rohini Alles-Somakumari Samarasinghe Netball Challenge Trophy with Hillwood College. Through these  fixtures, Gateway kids can test their mettle against their peers at  other schools and also engage more fully with the Kandy community.  Currently suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, these events will be resumed as soon as circumstances permit.  </p>
