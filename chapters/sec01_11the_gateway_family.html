		<p>Management, staff, students and parents – everyone who is or has ever been a part of the school – all belong to the Gateway family. Filial and fraternal community is the cornerstone of the school’s ethos, building cohesion and unity. Just as a family would, members of the Gateway community care for and sustain each other through good times and bad, celebrating and commiserating in unity.</p>
		<h2>Students</h2>
		<p>Gateway students are humble, driven, empathetic, affable and community-minded. They are all-rounders, successfully juggling academics, sports, the arts and other extracurricular activities. All Gateway students are trained to be leaders and are given the opportunity to take charge in some capacity or another. Whether they are overseeing a small group for an academic project or bear the heavier responsibilities of a prefect or president of a society, they learn to take their commitments seriously and execute their duties with care. </p>
		<p>Faith and mindfulness play an important role in the lives of Gateway students. All primary students follow classes in religious studies. Gateway’s unique syllabus teaches pupils about their own religion in the first two terms of each year, connecting them with their own faith. In the third term, they are exposed to the teachings of other mainstream religions, fostering respect for all faiths. </p>

		<p>Religious observances are held daily for the entire school. Rites of the four principal faiths of the country are celebrated. Students also begin each day by honing their attention and focus through a short ‘mindfulness routine’ incorporating such elements as mindful listening, mindful breathing, mindful seeing, mindful body scanning and mindful gratitude. The school’s MindUp programme helps participating pupils improve their powers of self-control, build resilience to stress and create a positive mindset towards school life and life in general. </p>
		<p>The relationship between students and teachers is marked by mutual respect. While there is an expectation that students will respect their teachers – an expectation incumbent upon the whole student body – this is reciprocated by the staff, who treat their charges with courtesy and kindness. In traditional Sri Lankan fashion, special regard is given to age: older students are addressed as aiya (‘big brother’) or akka (‘older sister’) by younger ones. The jacket worn by the A-level students is a token of their impending entry into adulthood and a respectful token of their seniority in the school.</p>
		<p>Gateway organises frequent learning excursions to expose pupils to various aspects of society and culture. These expeditions not only pull them out of their comfort zones, but open their eyes to aspects of Sri Lanka and the world they would not have otherwise been privy to. They also learn important life skills – for example, students who have travelled overseas on exchange programmes or for formal competitions are given special opportunities to speak to others about their first taste of independence, of contending with keeping schedules, managing money and coping with ‘business’ normally taken care of by their parents. </p>
		<p>Gateway students are excellent team players who know how to work collaboratively and cooperate with diverse personalities. Optimistic and positive, they view setbacks as challenges and opportunities for growth. They carry themselves with confidence, caring and considerate of everyone around them. </p>

				<h2>Alumni Association</h2>
		<p><span>Established in 2005, the Gateway Alumni Association creates a network for former students scattered around the world. Leaving school often creates a personal void, especially if a student has been a </span>part<span> of </span>the<span> school for an extended period of time. The Alumni Association aims to fill this lacuna by providing a supportive network and a sense of community. </span></p>
		<p>The three pillars of the association are ‘be social, go forward and give back.’ Accordingly, the association nurtures close bonds between past pupils across cohorts and branches, sustaining a community to which all former students can claim to belong, no matter where in the world they are. Regular social and sports events, such as dinner dances and cricket matches, keep them in close contact with one another.  The Alumni Association helps students make the move from school to the outside world, providing a network to which they can reach out at need. Regardless of what stage of life they are in – starting higher education, launching a career or any other pivotal time – they can rely on their fellows’ support. The Association also contributes to the current school community and to society at large, providing much-needed guidance and advice. The Association was highly active during the pandemic, raising funds for equipment that was in short supply in hospitals in Sri Lanka. Alumni visit their old schools often, speaking at assemblies and events and taking on the role of mentors to the young. Over the years, many former students have gained prominence as vital stakeholders in the school decision-making process, and some have returned to join the staff as teachers and administrators – which is something Gateway is very keen to encourage. </p>
		<p>There are five chapters of the association: Colombo, Kandy Dehiwala, Negombo and Australia. With the opening of the Australian chapter in Melbourne in 2019, Gateway College became the first international school in Sri Lanka to form an alumni association overseas. </p>
		<h2>Staﬀ</h2>
		<p>The school directorate is led by the Chairman, Dr Harsha Alles, and comprises Rohini Alles, the seniormost member of the board, Dinali Alles, Asoka Herath, Ramantha Alles and Anishka Alles. These leaders are hands-on: actively involved in the day-to-day functioning of the school. Their dedication is an inspiration to the teachers and non-academic staff, who are equally passionate, enthusiastic and diligent. Adaptable and ready for change, Gateway staff are able to rise to any challenge and ensure as smooth an educative process as possible for pupils. The commitment of the staff is testified to by their attendance rate – leave of absence, although available to everyone, is rarely taken. About half the staff, academic, administrative and support, have been in service at the school for ten years or more, with many having worked at Gateway for over twenty years. These figures are a clear indicator that those who work at Gateway are content to be there. </p>

		<p>The school takes pride in hiring qualified staff. All secondary teachers are graduates who bring with them valuable expertise from their respective fields. Continuing professional development is a priority for all; there is strong emphasis on upskilling and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in education. Training programmes and workshops are conducted in-house and, on occasion, off-site. Academic and non-academic staff alike are encouraged to improve their professional qualifications; those who succeed are appropriately recognised and rewarded. </p>
		<p>Ample opportunity is provided for teachers to move up the ranks. Ever eager to facilitate the career progress of their staff, Gateway management gives preference to existing employees when appointing staff to leadership roles such as department head, sectional head, assistant principal or deputy principal. </p>
		<p>While Gateway does recruit internationally, it prioritises hiring and developing Sri Lankan personnel. The country has many prominent, talented educationists, and Gateway has sought to learn and build on their expertise. For example, Nirmali Wickremesinghe, whose curriculum vitae includes ten years’ service as principal of Ladies’ College, one of the country’s top girls’ schools, has served as a consultant to the College as a whole since 2014, developing policy and curricula, training and mentoring teachers and acting as counsellor to branch heads.</p>
		<p>The entire staff body works as a team and all have the opportunity to provide input into significant decisions and policies. To deepen connections and promote leadership at multiple levels, staff members with relevant expertise are selected to serve as team leaders for issues that cut across the Gateway network. The highlight of every staff year is a two-day joint workshop that is held at a suitable hotel or similar venue at the beginning of the academic year. Much of the first day is spent collaborating, sharing best practices and planning schemes of work for the year ahead. There is a grand dinner-dance in the evening; this, not surprisingly, is the most-anticipated moment of the trip. The morning of the second day is usually spent on team-building activities and staff are driven back to their respective schools after lunch. Camaraderie, laughter and excitement set the tone for the upcoming school year. </p>
		<h2>Parents</h2>
		<p>Gateway parents are exceptionally supportive of the school. They step in to help with clubs and societies, supervising and chaperoning pupils. They readily volunteer to sit on organising committees that manage school events. They are generous with their time and resources, some of them continuing to be involved even after their children have left school. As the primary cheerleaders of the school, they show up in their numbers at sports tournaments, concerts and other significant occasions. Their commitment to the school stems from how they see themselves – as parents to all students and not just their own children. </p>
